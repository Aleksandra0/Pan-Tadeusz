# Word Search in Binary Search Tree

This project is a C program that processes a text file to extract all words, filters out common stop words, and stores the remaining words in a Binary Search Tree (BST). It then allows the user to search for a specific word and returns the depth of that word in the tree. 

Project was tested using the text of "Sir Thaddeus, or the Last Lithuanian Foray: A Nobleman's Tale from the Years of 1811 and 1812 in Twelve Books of Verse" (in Polish "Pan Tadeusz, czyli ostatni zajazd na Litwie. Historia szlachecka z roku 1811 i 1812 we dwunastu ksiÄ™gach wierszem") - a long poem written by great Polish romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz.
